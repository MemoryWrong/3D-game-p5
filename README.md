# Genetic Algorithm
this is demo visualise the output of neural network using p5.js
![alt text](https://github.com/MemoryWrong/Genetic-Algorithm-Demo/blob/master/gene.PNG)


## Instruction

```
1. Creating creatures which can pass the barrier and get the target.
2. Calculate the time elapsed for each creature finish the task.
3. Generate creature which have decent genes and generate children generation.
4. After running the program, calculate the creature with best genes array list.
5. Using p5.js library and genetic revolutionary algorithm.


```
## Theory
```
1. set DNA GENE ARRAY
2. generate children
3. DNA mutation using the top 10% ~5% of individuals to create children generation.
4. finishing the tasks and iterate steps above. 
5. evolution the process of the generation.

```
## Run the demo

```
1. npm install
2. node server.js
3. open localhost:3001 in the browser
